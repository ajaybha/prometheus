The strongest storms are then expected\nto move northward across Lassen County, the Surprise Valley and\nfar northwest Nevada this evening, including Susanville and\nCedarville.\n\nThe stronger storms will be capable of producing hail up to 1\ninch in diameter, wind gusts in excess of 45 mph, and significant\nlightning activity. Very heavy rainfall will produce ponding on\nroads and reduced visibility. Localized flash flooding is also\npossible, with the potential for debris flows, especially in\nareas where heavy rain falls on recent burn scars.\n\nFor the commute this afternoon, allow extra time for travel and\nkeep extra distance between vehicles. If you're planning outdoor\nactivities, watch the sky for developing thunderstorms, and head\nindoors if you hear thunder.",

Those with respiratory sensitivities should take extra\nprecaution to minimize exposure.\n\nFor more information on the status of Kilauea Volcano, please see\nhttps://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/status.html.\n\nFor health and safety recommendations, please visit the Hawaii\nInteragency Vog Information Dashboard at https://vog.ivhhn.org.\n\nThe USGS website for submitting ash reports can be found at\nhttp://hawaiiash.science.",

At 8.5 feet, county roads and bridges may have water\nflowing over them. Several homes could flood.\n\n* Water level rises on the Jefferson River will likely accelerate\nthroughout this week, as warm temperatures help increase snowmelt\nout of the mountains. Also, runoff from thunderstorms each day\nthis week will likely keep other rivers and creeks running high\nand fast.\n\n* Water levels could rise even further than what is currently\nforecasted, if significant rainfall occurs within the Jefferson\nRiver Basin. If you live in this area, we urge you to be\nprepared to take immediate action if floodwaters threaten your\nlife, property, and/or livestock.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nThree Forks, Trident, Willow Creek, Cardwell, Lewis And Clark\nCaverns State Park and Missouri Headwaters State Park.",
