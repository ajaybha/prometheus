The\nriver is expected to remain near its current level at this\nlocation through Monday night, so little change is expected.\n\n* At 5 pm Monday, the Wind River near Dubois was 5.0 feet and\nfalling. Minor flood stage is at 5.0 feet. The river is expected\nto fluctuate around 4.8 to 5.3 feet through Monday night and\nTuesday morning. Low land flooding intensifies and becomes more\nwidespread in and around Dubois at river levels near 5.5 feet.\n\n* At 5 pm Monday, the Wind River below Diversion Dam was near 5.1\nfeet. The river is expected to continue to rise and crest to near\n5.5 feet by late Tuesday morning. Minor flood stage is at 5.5\nfeet. At 5.5 feet, the river begins to overtop the left bank just\nupstream of the Highway 26 Bridge. This would lead to minor\nflooding of homes and property southeast of the Highway 26 Bridge.\n\n* At 5 pm Monday, the Wind River at Riverton was nearly steady at\n9.6 feet. The river is likely to remain between 9.5 and 9.9 feet\nthrough Tuesday. Minor flood stage is at 9.0 feet. At 10.0 feet,\nthere is extensive agricultural flooding downstream of Riverton\nnear the Black Bridge and Hidden Valley area.",

Tropical Storm\nWarnings remain in effect for the Florida Gulf Coast from the\nAucilla River to the Alabama line. However, these warnings are\nexpected to be dropped this evening. Tropical storm force winds have\nbeen observed at many locations from Keaton Beach to as far west as\nthe Bay-Walton County line.\n\nThere remains a risk for isolated tornadoes across the entire region\nthrough tonight. Bands of heavy rain will remain possible even as\nAlberto moves well inland. Additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6\ninches are expected with isolated higher amounts, mainly across the\nFlorida Panhandle, southeast Alabama and southwest Georgia. A Flash\nFlood Watch is in effect for these areas.\n\nPeak storm surge for this event occurred along the Florida Big Bend\ncoast during the afternoon high tide cycle. Inundation of 2 and 4\nfeet above ground level was observed. Storm surge watches have been\ndropped east of the Aucilla River and the remaining watch area will\nbe dropped this evening.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across the\nFLORIDA PANHANDLE and parts of SOUTHEAST ALABAMA. Remain well\nsheltered from hazardous wind having additional limited impacts. If\nrealized, these impacts include:\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are\nshallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\nElsewhere across the FLORIDA BIG BEND AND SOUTHWESTERN GEORGIA, little\nto no additional wind impact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPotential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across the\nregion. Remain well guarded against life-threatening flood waters\nhaving possible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.\nMany road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPotential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across EASTERN\nFLORIDA PANHANDLE...FLORIDA BIG BEND...SOUTHEASTERN ALABAMA...\nSOUTHWESTERN GEORGIA AND SOUTH CENTRAL GEORGIA. Remain prepared for\ntornado impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\n* SURGE:\nPotential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across\nthe WESTERN FLORIDA BIG BEND. Remain well away from locally hazardous\nsurge having additional limited impacts. If realized, these impacts\ninclude:\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas\nfarther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread\nwith surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where\nsurge water covers the road.\n- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly\nin usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,\nand piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across the FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND EASTERN BIG BEND, little to\nno additional impact is anticipated.",
                "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nDo not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all clear\nto return.\n\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nKeep your cell phone charged and in power-saving mode. If you lose\npower, use it sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and check-\nins.\n\nIf you are prone to flooding or in an area under a storm surge watch\nor warning, be prepared for the possibility of a quick and dramatic\nrise in water levels.\n\nIf a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the\nsafest place within your shelter. Protect your head and body.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",

Avoid restricted areas.\n- ACT: Dial 9 1 1 if you have a life-threatening emergency.\nPractice safety when moving about.\n\n- REALIZED IMPACTS: Being Assessed\n- Little to no additional wind impacts expected. Community\nofficials are now assessing the extent of actual wind\nimpacts accordingly.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: through early Thursday evening\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- The storm surge threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Shelter against storm surge flooding greater than 1\nfoot above ground.\n- PREPARE: All flood preparations should be complete. Expect\nflooding of low-lying roads and property.\n- ACT: Stay away from storm surge prone areas. Continue to\nfollow the instructions of local officials.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Unfolding\n- Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plans should still include the potential for a few\ntornadoes.\n- PREPARE: Keep informed should additional weather alerts be\nneeded.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- Local Weather Conditions and Forecasts: NWS Tallahassee\n- http://www.weather.gov/tallahassee",

                "description": "This product covers portions of southwest Alabama...northwest Florida...south\ncentral Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi.\n\n**CENTER OF ALBERTO MAKING LANDFALL NEAR LAGUNA BEACH FLORIDA**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- The Tropical Storm Warning has been cancelled for Escambia and\nEscambia Inland\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Covington, Escambia\nCoastal, Okaloosa Coastal, Okaloosa Inland, Santa Rosa Coastal,\nand Santa Rosa Inland\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 130 miles east-southeast of Mobile AL or about 80 miles\neast of Pensacola FL\n- 30.3N 85.9W\n- Storm Intensity 45 mph\n- Movement North or 355 degrees at 9 mph\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nAlberto is making landfall near Laguna Beach Florida and will continue\nnorthward into central Alabama through tonight. Alberto will have the\npotential to bring significant rainfall amounts and flash flooding to the\nregion, especially across the western Florida panhandle and much of\nsouthwest and south central Alabama mainly through tonight. Tropical\nstorm force winds will likely impact portions of the western Florida\npanhandle through this evening.  A Wind Advisory is in effect for much\nof the remaining area except for southeast Mississippi until the early\nevening for potential frequent wind gusts around 30 mph.  Storm surge\ninundation of 1 to 2 feet is possible until the early evening across\nportions of coastal Florida and a Coastal Flooding Advisory is in effect.\nShort lived isolated tornadoes will also be possible mainly through mid\nevening across portions of the western Florida panhandle and south\ncentral Alabama.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPotential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across\nthe western Florida panhandle and south central Alabama. Remain\nwell guarded against life-threatening flood waters having possible\nextensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. In mountain areas, destructive runoff\nmay run quickly down valleys while increasing susceptibility to\nrockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers\nmay become stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.\nMany road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across southwest Alabama.\n\n* WIND:\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across\nthe western Florida panhandle and some portions of south central Alabama.\nRemain well sheltered from hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.\nIf realized, these impacts include:\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are\nshallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\nA Wind Advisory is in effect through 6 pm today across portions of\nsouthwest Alabama and south central Alabama.  Elsewhere across southeast\nMississippi, little to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* SURGE:\nPotential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across\nportions of the western Florida panhandle. Remain well away from locally\nhazardous surge having possible limited impacts. If realized, these\nimpacts include:\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas\nfarther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread\nwith surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where\nsurge water covers the road.\n- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly\nin usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,\nand piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across portions of southwest Alabama...northwest\nFlorida...south central Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPotential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across some\nportions of south central Alabama. Remain well braced against a\ntornado event having possible limited impacts. If realized, these\nimpacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across portions of southwest Alabama...northwest\nFlorida...south central Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.",
                "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nDo not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all\nclear to return.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to stay inside and away from windows. Listen for\nupdates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Keep a\nbattery-powered radio, charged cell phone and flashlight handy.\n\nIf a tornado warning is issued for your area, quickly move to the\nsafest place within your shelter.

                "description": "Web cams and radar data have shown occasional small bursts of\nvolcanic ash from Halemaumau Crater this morning. These bursts\nhave reached near 15,000 feet. Additional bursts are possible at\nany time. Low level trade winds are expected to weaken some today.\nWith the recent trade wind flow, most of the ash has been pushed\nto the southwest, with any ash fallout focused over the Kau\nDistrict and Highway 11 southwest of the town of Volcano. This\nincludes the communities of Pahala, Wood Valley, Naalehu and Ocean\nView. As winds weaken today, its possible that any ash fallout\ncould reach other areas near the volcano, including areas to the\nnortheast along Highway 11 between Volcano, Glenwood and Mountain\nView.\n\nWinds will continue to help spread ash over the Kau District\narea. The repeated eruptions have led to some buildup of ash in\nthose areas which will continue even with the lighter winds. In\naddition, any ash deposited will likely be picked up by local\nwinds, contributing to dusty conditions.\n\nAvoid excessive exposure to ash which is an eye and respiratory\nirritant. Those with respiratory sensitivities should take extra\nprecaution to minimize exposure.",

                "description": "The remnants of Subtropical Storm Alberto are expected to move\nacross the Mid-State on Tuesday and Tuesday night, producing\naverage rainfall amounts of one to three inches. Some locally\nhigher amounts, perhaps to four inches or more, are also\npossible. Right now, it looks like the center of low pressure will\ntrack across western Middle Tennessee, with the swath of heaviest\nrainfall expected to occur near the Interstate 65 corridor,\nincluding the Nashville Metro area.\n\nOne of the main problems associated with tropical weather systems\nis the likelihood for heavy showers to train over the same area.\nAs a result, heavy rainfall can accumulate quickly and lead to the\npossibility of flash flooding. In addition, since it is difficult\nto know exactly where the heaviest rain bands will set up, it's\npossible that some places outside of the I-65 corridor could also\nsee high rain totals of 3 inches or more. As a result, the Flood\nWatch covers all of Middle Tennessee.\nThe Flash Flood Watch continues for\n\n* A portion of Middle Tennessee, including the following areas,\nBedford, Cannon, Cheatham, Clay, Coffee, Cumberland, Davidson,\nDe Kalb, Dickson, Fentress, Giles, Grundy, Hickman, Houston,\nHumphreys, Jackson, Lawrence, Lewis, Macon, Marshall, Maury,\nMontgomery, Overton, Perry, Pickett, Putnam, Robertson,\nRutherford, Smith, Stewart, Sumner, Trousdale, Van Buren,\nWarren, Wayne, White, Williamson, and Wilson.\n\n* From Tuesday morning through Wednesday morning\n\n* Average rainfall amounts of one to three inches, with locally\nhigher amounts to four inches or more.\n\n* Some flash flooding is possible. In addition, you can expect\nrises to occur on area creeks and streams, and possibly along\nlarger rivers as well.",
                "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action\nshould Flash Flood Warnings be issued.",

Rapidly increasing rainfall rates from\ntropical showers and embedded thunderstorms expected Tuesday\nthrough Wednesday morning. The resulting heavy rainfall will\nimpact many locations that are already saturated by heavy rain\nthat fell over the past two weeks. This will greatly heighten the\nrisk of flash flooding.\nThe National Weather Service in Blacksburg has issued a\n\n* Flash Flood Watch for portions of North Carolina, Virginia,\nand southeast West Virginia, including the following areas, in\nNorth Carolina, Alleghany NC, Ashe, Stokes, Surry, Watauga,\nWilkes, and Yadkin. In Virginia, Bedford, Bland, Carroll,\nFloyd, Franklin, Giles, Grayson, Henry, Montgomery, Patrick,\nPulaski, Roanoke, Smyth, Tazewell, and Wythe. In southeast\nWest Virginia, Mercer.\n\n* From Tuesday morning through Wednesday morning\n\n* Abundant tropical moisture arriving across the region will\nresult in heavy rains. Rainfall totals from the heavy tropical\nshowers and embedded thunderstorms could reach 1 to 3 inches\nwith locally higher amounts possible over a saturated ground.\n\n* Expect flash flooding in areas of torrential rainfall. Flash\nflooding of streams and creeks may develop very quickly under\nthese circumstances.",

                "description": "* The warm air temperatures in the upper 70s on Tuesday may cause\npeople to underestimate the dangers of the cold water temperatures\nwhich are currently only in the lower 50s across Lake Champlain,\nand in the lower 50s in the regions smaller lakes and rivers.\n\n* The cold water temperatures can quickly cause hypothermia to\nanyone immersed in the water. When the water temperature is below\n60 degrees, the average submerged person could loose dexterity\nwithin minutes and be unable to accomplish simple tasks. Anyone\non small boats, canoes or kayaks should plan accordingly if\nrecreating this weekend and use extreme caution to avoid this\nthreat. Paddle smart from the start and always wear your life\njacket!\n\n* Breezy winds are also expected Tuesday with gusts up to 25 mph from\nthe north. If boating on large bodies of water, these strong winds\ncan increase the likelihood of overturning your boat,canoe or\nkayak due to increased wave heights.",

                "description": "The broad circulation around Alberto is pumping abundant\ntropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean\nacross the southeast. Rapidly increasing rainfall rates from\ntropical showers and embedded thunderstorms will continue tonight\nand this heavy rainfall will likely persist across much of the\narea into Wednesday night. The resulting heavy rainfall will\nimpact many locations that are already saturated by heavy rain\nthat fell over the past two weeks. This will greatly heighten the\nrisk of flash flooding and main stem river flooding throughout the\nwestern Carolinas and northeast Georgia, as well as landslides\nalong the steeper slopes of the mountains and adjacent foothills.\nThe Flash Flood Watch is now in effect for\n\n* portions of northeast Georgia, western North Carolina, and\nupstate South Carolina, including the following areas, in\nnortheast Georgia, Rabun. In western North Carolina, Avery,\nBuncombe, Burke Mountains, Caldwell Mountains, Eastern\nMcDowell, Eastern Polk, Graham, Greater Burke, Greater\nCaldwell, Greater Rutherford, Haywood, Henderson, Macon,\nMadison, McDowell Mountains, Mitchell, Northern Jackson, Polk\nMountains, Rutherford Mountains, Southern Jackson, Swain,\nTransylvania, and Yancey. In upstate South Carolina,\nGreenville Mountains, Oconee Mountains, and Pickens Mountains.\n\n* through Thursday morning\n\n* Abundant tropical moisture arriving across the mountains and\nfoothills will likely persist through at least mid week.\nRainfall totals from the heavy tropical showers and embedded\nthunderstorms should reach 3 to 6 inches by Thursday, with many\nlocations along the eastern and southern slopes of the southern\nAppalachians seeing 6 to 8 inches. Locally heavier rainfall will\nbe possible in locations that see repeated rounds of\nthunderstorms, where rainfall rates could reach 1 to 2 inches\nper hour in the heaviest downpours. This heavy rain will fall on\nground already saturated by rainfall over the past two weeks.\n\n* Flash flooding of streams and creeks may develop very quickly\nunder these circumstances. Landslides will be quite possible,\nespecially in mountainous terrain known to be prone to\nlandslides, and even along some steep slopes where landslides\nhave not occurred for many years. Main stem river flooding\nwill be quite likely as well, especially along rivers in the\nsouthern and central North Carolina mountains such as the\nFrench Broad River, the Tuckasegee River, and the Little\nTennessee River.",
                "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation.\nMake plans now to avoid travel during the peak of the heavy\nrainfall. Also have plans on where to flee to higher ground if\nflash flooding affects your location.\n\nRainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been\nassociated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides.\nIf you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a\nmountain, especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance\nof the storm or as quickly as possible should rising water,\nmoving earth, or rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel on\nmountain roads during the period of heavy rainfall today through\nWednesday.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action\nshould Flash Flood Warnings be issued.",

The\nhighest flooding potential exists over the northern and western\nportions of the forecast area. A flash flood watch is in effect\nfor north and portions of central Georgia until 8 AM Wednesday.\n\nWIND:\nThe strongest sustained winds of 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35\nmph will be possible over west Georgia with the strongest winds\nover west central Georgia, from this evening through Tuesday. Due\nto the saturated soils, it could be easier for strong winds to\nbring down trees, which could lead to isolated power outages. A\nwind advisory is in effect for a portion of west central Georgia\nalong the Alabama border until 8 AM Tuesday.\n\nTORNADOES:\nIsolated brief tornadoes will be possible across the area later\ntoday and Tuesday associated with the rain bands.",

Alberto then continues northward into central Alabama\nthrough tonight.  Alberto will have the potential to bring significant\nrainfall amounts and flash flooding to the western Florida panhandle\nand much of southwest and south central Alabama mainly through tonight.\nTropical storm force winds will likely impact portions of the western\nFlorida panhandle and extreme south central Alabama through early\nevening.  A Wind Advisory is in effect for much of the remaining area\nexcept for southeast Mississippi for potential frequent wind gusts\naround 30 mph.  Storm surge inundation of 1 to 2 feet is possible\ntoday across portions of coastal Florida and a Coastal Flooding\nAdvisory is in effect.  Short lived isolated tornadoes will also be\npossible mainly this afternoon through mid evening across portions of\nthe western Florida panhandle and south central Alabama.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPotential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across\nthe western Florida panhandle and south central Alabama today. Remain\nwell guarded against life-threatening flood waters having possible\nextensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. In mountain areas, destructive runoff\nmay run quickly down valleys while increasing susceptibility to\nrockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers\nmay become stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.\nMany road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across southwest Alabama.\n\n* WIND:\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across\nthe western Florida panhandle and some portions of south central Alabama.\nRemain well sheltered from hazardous wind having possible limited impacts.\nIf realized, these impacts include:\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are\nshallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\nA Wind Advisory is in effect through this afternoon across portions of\nsouthwest Alabama and south central Alabama.  Elsewhere across southeast\nMississippi, little to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* SURGE:\nPotential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across\nportions of the western Florida panhandle. Remain well away from locally\nhazardous surge having possible limited impacts. If realized, these\nimpacts include:\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas\nfarther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread\nwith surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where\nsurge water covers the road.\n- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly\nin usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,\nand piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across portions of southwest Alabama...northwest\nFlorida...south central Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPotential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across some\nportions of south central Alabama and the western Florida panhandle.\nRemain well braced against a tornado event having possible limited\nimpacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across portions of southwest Alabama...northwest\nFlorida...south central Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.",

Anyone\non small boats, canoes or kayaks should plan accordingly if\nrecreating this weekend and use extreme caution to avoid this\nthreat. Paddle smart from the start and always wear your life\njacket!\n\n* Strong winds are also expected this weekend with gusts up to 24\nmph from the south. If boating on large bodies of water, these\nstrong winds can increase the likelihood of overturning your boat,\ncanoe or kayak due to increased wave heights.",
