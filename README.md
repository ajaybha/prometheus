# Project Prometheus

<p>An early fire detection AI technology using drones. Named after Prometheus, the Greek TItan, who defies the gods by stealing fire and giving it to humanity, an act that enabled progress and civilization. We are itching to do the same.</p>

<p>We combine surveillance drones and concepts of machine learning to detect wildfires while they are still in their early stages. The concept is to leverage the vast amounts of wildfire images and videos available on the internet to train a machine learning algorithm to detect the presence of a fire, however small it may be. The drone would then fly over parks and forests collecting the images. An algorithm  will determine the confidence level at which it believes a region is about to develop a fire.
